    <h3>Computer nerd and swell guy</h3>
    <p>
      Here are some things you might (or might not) like to know about me:
    </p>
    <ul>Some  things of possible intertest
      <li>
        I have been involved in software development for over 20 years, but never learned web development.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am married to a wonderful woman named Sharon 
      </li>
      <li>
        We have 3 children.  <br>2 are living:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Samantha (who goes by Elijah)
          </li>
          <li>
            Isabella (who goes by Izy)
          </li>
        </ol>
        One is deceased:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Nikolas (who we call Niko).  An interesting fact: My wife is a big fan of <em>TheWizard of Oz</em> and we did not know until well after Niko died that the head flying monkey in that movie is named Niko.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
